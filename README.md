    1. Blog post loading
        - single post
        - list of posts
    2. Blog post creation
    3. Comment creation
    
## Deployment setup

## Assumptions
- Field data sent from the front end will be in JSON format
- For simplicity, all ids for the MVP will be integers of specific digit lengths. Features like encryption and the use of UUIDs will be in the Future Wish List :)

- Improve tests (test error handling, set up TestContext suite for requests, etc.)
- Implement a front end UI
- Implement post editing
- Implement text formatting and customization when creating blog posts
- Implement the ability to add images to blog posts
- Implement user registration
- Implement user account features
- Implement security features
